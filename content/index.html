  <h3>What is OONI?</h3>
  <p>
  OONI is the Open Observatory for Network Interference and its aim is to
  collect high quality data using open methodologies, using Free and Open
  Source Software (FL/OSS) to share observations and data about the kind,
  methods and amount of surveillance and censorship in the world
  </p>

  <p>
  This is a human rights observation project for the Internet. OONI seeks to
  observe levels of surviellance, censorship, and networked discrimination
  by networked authoritarian power structures.
  </p>

  <p>
    The end goal of the OONI project is to collect data which shows
    an accurate representation of network interference on the Filternet
    we call the internet

  <h3>Updates</h3>
    <h5><a href="/releases/2012/Handara_Palestine.html">23 April 2012: Politically motivated censorship in Palestine</a></h5>
    <p>
    The ISP Hadara in the city of Bethlehem, West Bank, Palestine is
    restricting access to certain news websites. To do so they are using a
    transparent HTTP proxy running Squid.
    </p>

    <h5><a href="/releases/2012/T-Mobile_USA_WebGuard.html">19 March 2012: Released the T-Mobile USA Web Guard censorship list</a></h5>
    <p>T-Mobile USA offers a "feature" to restrict access to certain kinds of content.
    This is called Web Guard. Supposedly Web Guard is supposed to inhibit access to
    content that falls under the following categories: Alcohol, Mature Content, Violence,
    Drugs, Pornography,  Weapons, Gambling, Suicide, Guns, Hate, Tobacco, Ammunition.
    </p>
    <p>
    By developing an OONI-probe test we were able to extract part of the list of censored content
    and discovered that sites that do not fall under these categories were also censored.
    This feature is enabled by default on all prepaid accounts and although it can be disabled
    by customers who wish to do so (if over 18 years of age), it is not clearly stated in the
    error page how to do so. This means that T-Mobile USA customers may be drawn into the Filternet
    without knowing how to get out.<br />
